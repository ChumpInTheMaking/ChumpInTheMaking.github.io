	You've traveled very far from home...






	Do you remember how your long and winding journey 
	began with a tour of the city of Onadbyr led by
	Wordsplasher the bard? Gnolls attacked your group
	on that fateful day, and the five of you stuck
	together, a binding in time.






	On your way, you have walked, thought, and fought,
  making friends, forming alliances, and bringing 
  light to darkness. Yet through all this, you have 
  never lost your courage. You have grown steadily 
  stronger, though you have experienced the pain of 
  battle many times.






  You are no longer alone in your adventure. 
	Deevey, the mage, lights your way with his magic,
	lending you his wit and comraderie.
	The goliath, Fin, supports you with his strength
	that belies his gentle heart.
	Torggo, the dwarf, keeps the darkness at bay, and 
  his doggedness keeps you afloat.
	Eridesce, the child, reminds you what is good as
	her powers restore your vitality.
	And Locke, the rogue, encourages you to live your
	life to the fullest, while removing your obstacles.
	As you certainly know by now, you are not a 
	regular group of people. You have an awesome destiny 
	to fulfill!






  A purple rain falls, and a dark shroud has fallen upon
  the kingdom. The journey from this point will be long, 
  and it will be more difficult than anything you have 
  undergone to this point. Yet, I know you will be all right. 
  When good battles evil, which side do you believe wins? 
  Do you have faith that good is triumphant?






  One thing you must never lose is courage. If you believe 
	in the goal you are striving for, you will be courageous. 
	There are many difficult times ahead, but you must keep 
	your sense of humor, work through the tough situations,
	and enjoy yourself. When you have finished this cup
  of coffee, your adventure will begin again. 





  
       	Fin...
          Locke...
             Torggo...
               Deevey...
	         Eridesce...






	I wish you luck...
