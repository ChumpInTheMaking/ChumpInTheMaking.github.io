      <div class="entry-title">Arrival at Onadbyr</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 1 - May 30, 2025</div>
      Wow, this city is big - bigger than anywhere else I've ever been! I decided to get a tour of the city with a local bard who goes by Wordsplasher. We walked by a place called the Alley of Menace that folks were warned never to go near. Naturally, these gnoll schmucks waltz right in, and ran right back out. Problem was, they came out swinging those axes of theirs! Me and a few other folks stood their ground and prevented Wordsplasher's guts from splashing all over the cobblestone. To thank us, he bought us a round at the Lucky Leap, where we all got to know each other a bit. There's Deevey, a human - around my age, I think. There's Torggo, a dwarven cleric. Fin is a goliath with a massive axe. Oh, there's also this kid slinging spells who can't be more than ten years old - Eridesce, I think.  I got invited to some shindig by some fancypants noble at the end of the week. Anyway, I'm writing this from a room in the Blackhorn, where I'm staying my first night. Adventure awaits!

      <div class="entry-title">Busy Days in Onadbyr</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 2 - June 6, 2025</div>
      Another day - more adventure in Onadbyr! In the morning, Torggo said he had an errand to run at the Temple of Life. I wanted to see more of the city, so it made sense to accompany him - and sure enough, everyone ended up coming along, too - the kid and the giant and the wizard. Folks down on their luck were - get this - turning into pigs! It didn't take long for Torggo to figure out that someone was spiking the oatmeal - vile behavior. I got to see the Redcloaks in action - judge and jury. Best not to break a law while I'm here. Anyway, after that we looked into something Deevey was interested in - a dwarf had gone missing after he had claimed to enter a sunken tower that hadn't been breached in hundreds of years. We did some investigating - after 'entering' his home, we discovered a handful of animated skeletons trashing the place! After dispatching them, suffering a few bumps and bruises, we found the dwarf - Tightlips - hiding in a secret compartment. He paid us with some pretty nice jewelry! While him and Torggo boarded up the tunnel he had made, folks ran some errands. I sold the jewelry and divvied up the coin - someone noticed I had received an odd coin with a golden mask that apparently is a symbol of some secret society - I wonder who handed it to me? Later, I shadowed the kid to a grove she wanted to visit - just to be on the safe side. She turned into a wolf! I got out of there - I, uh, don't think she needs looking over any more. After some late night relaxing at the Blackhorn, enjoying their fine mead, Fin had waay too much and crashed out. The owners wanted him out, but we didn't exactly know where he was staying, so we brought him up to my room instead to sleep it off. After we caught our breath, we heard a kid screaming outside, so we went to investigate. Some lady was trying to kidnap a kid no older than Eri! We spooked her, I guess, 'cause she just vanished after Deevey tried a Magic Missile on her. The kid couldn't walk - something about a magical curse - and it sent me back to that moment years ago. I knew we had to do everything in our power to fix him - but as it turns out, she had whispered the solution to the boy - he had to dance with a giant. The next morning, he did some groovin' with Fin, and sure enough, he was cured! Despite it all, hanging out with these folks has been a lot of fun. Maybe I'll take them with me to the Fancypants Ball later this week!

      <div class="entry-title">City Life</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 3 - June 13, 2025</div>
      It's been a few days since I updated this log - what's happened? Let me just start by writing that I begrudingly attended the in-hindsight-poorly-named Fancypants Ball and ended up catching some sort of fever there. I will write no more of that. I went rumor hunting in the city by doing some bar hopping - tavernkeeps always know what's going on, whether it's a big city like Onadbyr or a dump like Yellowkeep. There's a fancy ball coming up in a few days - maybe we can wrangle an invitation somehow.  Fin also had a lead on some work working as a sous chef for a local food competition. We served food to the Princess - I think I'll speak for all the citizens of Onadbyr when I say that I'm glad she's not in line to the throne. Anyway, I thought my side had the victory in hand, but the kid - er, Eridesce - helped her chef pull it out in the end. We walked away with a princey - or should I say princessly - sum. Royals will spend tons of money on anything, it appears! I also discovered some old writing on a wall near the Alley of Menace - turns out it was a lead to a bonafide treasure hunt! It led to the bottom of an old bar, where we've convinced the owners to dig around in exchange a lot of coin, but we get to keep what we find! I'll take the lead when we get in there - hopefully no one gets hurt. I also learned that someone's daughter - a halfling girl named Byra - had gone adventuring and hadn't returned. I agreed to help without reservation, and luckily my new friends agreed. We traveled a few days north of the city to a lumberjack camp where a manticore had been harassing the workers - Byra had come here to slay the manticore. She'd been missing for a while, but we tracked her down a few hours away - trapped in a huge web! It turns out she had a pretty good plan, but had accidentally trapped both her and the manticore. Her 'secret weapon' was possessed by some sort of worm creature. It was a scary fight, but my friends and I prevailed with Byra's help. Byra wants to be an adventurer, but I tried to talk some sense into her - it's best to travel with a party, or a partner. I'm well aware that's still no guarantee of safety.  I feel like I ought to have moved on by now, but these new colleagues keep pulling me back in.  At least the coin is good so far.

      <div class="entry-title">Odd Jobs</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 4 - June 20, 2025</div>
      I'm writing this entry from the Blackhorn, where I continue to stay with the kid and Torggo. I haven't got around to forging my own path, yet - the coin is just too good! Our treasure hunt paid off big - we found a magical adamantine spear buried in an old saferoom underneath that bar. 200 GP split five ways was more than worth it - I bet the adamantium alone would be worth that, let alone the enchantment! I was going to fence it, but later that evening, the spear found some use. Someone had dropped off a burial urn for Torggo at the Blackhorn. But when Deevey tried to take it back home for analysis, a ghost popped out, wanting revenge! It possessed Deevey, and nearly killed Torggo and Fin. I was scared shitless! Our weapons and spells weren't much use, so, thinking fast, I threw the magic spear to Fin, who was able to score some effective blows. We also did an odd job cleaning out some old mansion for a well-renowned mercenary group - perhaps this will lead to more opportunities down the road. Pretty easy work - but the mansion was full of mold that Eri had to blast with ice, and some small ice elementals were a minor nuisance. Deevey found some pearl earrings that might pay off big. Oh - also, Byra's parents were real thankful when her daughter came back home. Not only did we score an unlimited supply of day-old baked goods, we got a job that gets us in to the invitation only ball. What else... oh, we also heard that the King and Prince had taken a retinue to some local bog or something and hadn't come back yet. Weird. Anyway, got to get to sleep - the kid wanted to go to some menagerie tomorrow, and apparently if I pretend to be her parent, we get in free. Actually, now that I write it down, it sounds fun!
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <div class="entry-title">Crime and Punishment</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 5 - June 27, 2025</div>
      Hey, it's me, again. The menagerie was a lot of fun - I think I ended up eating more spiced nuts than Eri, though. On our way out, we spotted an old man who had just been stabbed! We ran to help him, and thanks to a little magic from Eri's berries, he recovered. He was Lord Karramosa - and to show his thanks, he gave us a sack of gold and some tickets to his invitation-only gala. A few days later, we attended the gala - I had to buy some nice clothes for the occasion. Locke, old boy, you don't clean up half-bad! Anyway, the food was great - exotic stuff - and the wine was superb - not that I know anything about that. Apparently Lord Karramosa is in more danger than he thinks - Eri and Deevey swear they saw the drink he was handed had been spiked in some way, implicating his young wife and her friend, Victoria Violet. Er - more about that later. Eri made a show of spilling his glass to save him, but needs to work on selling it a bit more. Later, I snuck away and ran into Byra for a bit. It was nice to talk about old times, and the old days. I like Byra quite a bit - she reminds me of, well, me. After the party wrapped up, we were walking home when we came across some young folks from the party - one of them was crying, holding their ankle. Torggo went to help, but they pulled knives on him! We fought in a tight skirmish - our opponents knew what they were doing - clearly experts, and they had poisoned blades! We laid them low, but Deevey caused another commotion with his Thunderwave spell. In a panic, we took one of the ones that Deevey had caused to fallen asleep back to the Blackhorn. We tried to interrogate her, but she wasn't talking. That's when I learned I'm not cut out for this kind of work - Deevey and Torggo wanted to torture or kill her! I stuck to my guns, though - I'm not a killer. We settled on a plan of dumping her - alive - in the outskirts of town, where Eri hid as a spider - wow! - on her person and found out that she worked for - get this - Vickie Violet! I don't know what we'll do next, but I know this - I'm getting a new room in a differnt tavern - it isn't safe here anymore.

      <div class="entry-title">Movin' On Up</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 6 - July 11, 2025</div>
      Hey - I gotta write this one quick. After the encounter with the assassins, we decided to lose some heat by visiting the Gorse estate up north to return some pearl earrings we found. Apparently House Gorse has fallen on hard times - they used to be respectable folk, but there's defintely some weirdness going on. We managed to get an audience, but all the locals and some guards warned us that the Gorses can be... mecurial. Anyway, I drew the short straw and ended up trying to explain to the head Gorse that we were returning some earrings that belonged to his family. I did that trick that Celeste taught me - she always did it better. Old man Gorse was definitely in a bad spot, but seeing those earrings seemed to bring some clarity to his mind as he remembered. Get this - in return for the earrings, he gave us the deed to his estate in the capital! What a score! There's a lot of fixing up that needs to happen, but real estate in that location - it's worth a fortune! Later, back in the capital after we got the paperwork for the manse filed, we stopped by the Lucky Leap for information and drinks. While we were there, some halfling was trying to sell a valuable feather to the Crown Warden. He had the sale complete, but some loan shark came in and demanded some money he was owed, burning the feather in the process. We tried to help him out by getting another from his granny, but it turns out that the feathers were worthless. I wonder what happened to him? To make things ever weirder, the Crown Warden stopped by our manor the next morning, explanining that he was not involved in that transaction - someone was posing as him! To clear his name, he hired us for some work to check on a servant and retrieve a horse - apparently there's some folks doing dark rituals. That doesn't sound good. Gotta go - I'll write again when back in the city.
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <div class="entry-title">Strange Happenings</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 7 - July 18, 2025</div>
      Hey. It's been a few weeks - I thought I should write an update. We went out to the country like I wrote earlier, and found a stable that had been lit aflame. We were able to save the horses, and a servant let us know there were some folks, including the Crown Warden's servant, being held hostage nearby. We rushed to their aid, finding some folks in the middle of dark rituals, just like we'd heard. We fought some sort of devil - a devil! - but we weren't able to save the servants and the children the devil murdered. Is this what being an adenturer really is? Innocent folks dying? I've had enough of that.

      But happier things have happened, too. The kid - Eridesce - celebrated her 10th birthday. Byra's become a friend. We're making money. I gotta remember what I promised her - that I'd live the life she wanted me to live. Coming up is the King's Games - it's going to be a lot of fun. I'm planning on competing in quite a few events - you can't win if you don't play, right?
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <div class="entry-title">The King's Last Games</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 9 - August 8, 2025</div>
      Hey.

      Why do I write these entries?

      Is it so that I can remember what's happened? Is it so that should I lose my life in some obscure tomb, that others may know who I was? Sometimes I can convince myself that I write these so you can read them someday. Think of all the things we'd catch up on!

      Regardless, an update - Onadbyr is in a state of chaos. We performed well in the King's Games - I personally took 1st in a couple of events, and placed in a couple others. Our team, party, whatever, represented ourselves well. After the set of games, we stopped by the Lucky Leap for a victory feast, but fate had other things in mind. A group of criminals tried to rob the joint while Ricio was out. Some goon took Holla hostage - I tried to deescalate the situation. It didn't work - the goon slit Holla's throat and only lived thanks to the timely intervention of Eridesce. Watching the barmaid fall, I kind of lost control of myself for a second, and charged the guy, killing him. I don't like killing - but in that moment, protecting Holla, ending the threat, I felt like a machine.

      Some of us - me, Torggo, Fin - decided to participate in the last event, a series of duels in an arena. I drew a knight in shining armor for my first opponent, and was able to rope-a-dope him until I struck the winning blow. Good thing, too - I could sense he was about to smite the fight out of me. Unfortunately, I drew Fin for my second opponent. Apparently, I lost - I don't remember anything but the King's healers bringing me back to consciousness. Gods help the poor fool that has to fight Fin in an actual fight!

      For the final semifinal match, the Raven Knight fought the King. But, the Raven Knight turned out to be Onadbyr's supposedly lost or dead old Queen - who promptly slew the King and disappeared, like a fiend would. What will we do now? What will I do now?
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <div class="entry-title">The Hag Tree</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 11 - August 22, 2025</div>
      Hey, I'm back in Onadbyr as I write this. We went on a road trip to the Hag Tree - just trying to figure out what the hells are going on with this kingdom. For some reason, they moved the brat's coronation up to the solstice - I don't like it one bit. Before we left, I fucking came down with another sickness - sewer plague, they called it. Awful stuff - wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. After recovering, we hit the road, and I felt alive again after being down in the dumps earlier. Seeing new sights with my friends, killing some zombies or whatnot, exploring new places, getting drunk. We finally made it to the Hag Tree - and it smelled rotten from the start. I can see why we were warned not to travel there - there wasn't a living creature for miles, or a living plant for sixty feet or so. Torggo, the brave fool, wanted to climb under the tree to explore, but the damn evil coming off that tree felt so much like...well, that moment before. I snapped and tackled him, preventing - or convincing - him not to.

      Anyway, after seeing it for ourselves we made it back, about a week before the coronation. Some folks from Yellowkeep are even staying in our manor - I wonder if anyone recognizes me? They'd probably recognize Celeste.
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <div class="entry-title">Disaster</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 12 - September 12, 2025</div>
      Well, the city's gone to Hell. I wish that were a euphemism. At the coronation, well, all Hell broke loose. The crown transformed into some sort of thorny thing. The queen mother and brat princess, the new Queen, summoned some awful sort of magic. They protected themselves with a Wall of Force - funny how my studies still come in handy - and transformed more than half the guard into some sort of were-hellhound monstrosities. We were lucky to get out of their with our lives - my daggers did nothing even when I plunged one right into the heart of one of the hounds, but I remembered that silver might hurt creatures like these. Luckily, there was plenty of silver to be found in the serving utensils of the party - I grabbed some silver cutlery while Fin made good use of a silver platter. Torrgo's radiance was useful in clearing the way, and Eridesce summoned some moonlight that the creatures hated. 

      Cyne Monder cut a way out for us, and he told us to meet later at the Lucky Leap. A strange purple rain had started to fall, and one of our party warned us not to tarry in it. After checking in at the manse, we met up with Ricio and Cyne at the Leap. We resolved that we had to somehow cleanse the crown from its curse - that means stealing it. But before we can steal it, we have to be able to get to it. Apparently, Ricio has a lead on an adventurer who - get this - had a magic key that can open any lock. Imagine! He had headed to an ancient tomb of a powerful archmage and hadn't returned.

      Funny - I didn't even think about splitting - not even once. I like these folks, and I like this city. It needs help. It's what Celeste would do too, I think. It's an archmage's tomb, isn't it? Maybe what I've been searching for all these years will be found below.
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <div class="entry-title">The Archmage's Tomb</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 13 - September 19, 2025</div>
      After some preparations, we made our way northeast to where Ricio's adventurer friend was last heard from - a tomb of an ancient artificer/archmage. The adventurer supposedly had an item of great interest on him - a magical key that can open any lock. It was about a day's journey to where the tomb was suspected to be - we had to travel in that accursed purple rain. It was tough going for the mules we bought to move our covered wagon forward - one died on the travel there, unable to breathe. I directed the wagon forward - a magic necklace I had procured seems to protect my breathing well enough.

      I had a lot of time to myself to think, getting soaked in the purple rain. Of course, I was excited to brave a new tomb - who knows what treasures might lie inside? But as we get closer, I got more and more nervous. I kept thinking about - well, you know. What if something were to happen to these new friends? I've started to care for them.

      Once there, I took charge. Trying to hide my nervousness, I warned everyone to be careful. I gave orders. I tried to explain there was nothing here worth dying for.
      We made our way in. There was a green dragon already there - it was tense. We agreed to explore alongside him, splitting any valuables. I don't think either side trusted the either, and there were a few times I think he thought about ending us then and there.

      After I picked a magical lock to get us inside, the tomb was filled with old books and maps. Eventually, after fighting off a rogue automaton (that net we won in Onadbyr came in handy), we found the dead adventurer and his magic key. We also found some sort of metal monstrosity that nearly ended us.

      Regardless... we succeeded! Everyone walked out alive and in one piece - magic key in hand. I'm writing this from the capital - the next step is to empty a magical chest of Ricio's in the only safe place possible - a room of antimagic. Exciting!
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <div class="entry-title">A Trip to the Zoo</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 14 - September 26, 2025</div>
      Rather than empty Ricio's chest, a more pressing need emerged. The old architect of the royal palace, Mr. Tyk, had gone into hiding, being hunted by the city guards. We needed him because he knows the secret routes into the castle, of which we will travel to sneak in and steal the crown, eventually.

      First, we cased his home. Some guards had already showed up in the lobby of his apartment building, so I threw up a grappling hook and climbed up, Eridesce already ahead of me in spider form. We found some, well, shit at his house - shit that indicated he might be hiding out at the menagerie.

      When we got there, it had been locked up, and for good reason. This gods-forsaken rain had transformed the place, like it transformed the local plants at the manor. We soon discovered the local fauna had been affected, too - Old Gnarly, the monster crocodile, could talk, for one. He probably wanted to eat us, so we gave him a warning shot and he swam away. We were able to rescue the old groundskeeper, who had been stuck in the cage they fed Old Gnarly with in the past. He and his son let us know that there were some well hidden tunnels the employees used to feed the animals that Tyk and his friends might be hiding in.

      After getting by an angry owlbear who could scream thunder at us, and convincing a pair of griffons we meant them no harm, we got into the tunnels and found the vagabonds. I talked my way past them and they let me go talk to Mr. Tyk. I was able to copy a layout of the underground tunnels into the castle from Mr. Tyk's collection - man, I love maps!

      Next, to empty Ricio's chest...
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <div class="entry-title">The Emporium of Marvelous Rarities</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 15 - October 3, 2025</div>
      Hey. We did a great deal of schemeing on how to get safely into the Exporium - Ricio had all the details. It was protected by a great deal of wards and several apprentices, as well as the archmage himself. Not only that - to open the vault that leads to the antimagic chamber we need, four levers needed to be pulled within ten minutes time of each other.

      Ricio entered on pretense of having it out with his old nemesis, and Finn went with him as his muscle. In the meantime, the rest of us used a diversion to enter further into the Emporium, leaving Torggo to barter and bluster, buying us time. Detecting and dispelling magic as we went, we went upstairs and pulled two of the levers. One room was occupied by a incredibly lifelike golem that looked creepily like Ricio's ex. She begged to come with us, and I couldn't bear the thought of leaving her trapped in that room - Celeste continues to haunt me. We made it to the basement, knocking out an apprentice and destroying a statue that came to life. We continued to disarm magical traps, and I finally made my way into the antimagic room.
      
      As soon as I got in there, some sort of mental energy immediately slammed into me. I was able to use some of the magical diassociation techiques I learned in my studies, but my head still isn't quite right - I'll need some rest, I think. Anyway, in the chamber, the archmage was already there, looking at me curiously. There were so many rarities of great value in the room, but I had no time to dilly-dally. I opened the chest of antimagic and threw the accursed idol in the corner of the room, then skedaddled.

      Still reeling, we ran as fast as we could back to the entrance, where we were intercepted by the teleporting archmage. Rather than turn us all into toads or something, he reacted with sadness at the golem's departure, and let us all leave with our lives. Ricio was shocked to see this thing - he's gonna have a lot of issues to work through.

      When we returned to the Leap, we found it aflame, clearly the work of those were-hellhounds. Our worst fears were confirmed - Cyne Monder and his loyal knights had been slain. I fear we will be next.
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <div class="entry-title">Out of the Frying Pan...</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 18 - October 24, 2025</div>
      I finally have a spare moment to write something down, and, if possible, things are even worse than before. Let me write quickly.
      The golem with us panicked at the sight of the fire, and we decided to split up, the rest of the party entering the ablaze Leap looking for Cyne, while I chased down the lifelike construct. I was finally able to calm her down, and thought about where I should head next. In the distance, I saw smoke coming from Cyne's manor in the distance, so, fearing for our own home, I headed there. I was just in time to see the rest of my friends entering Cyne's old crypt, and we rendezvoused there. 

      Inside, some of those blasted Golden Masks had wasted no time in attempting to loot the crypt of the slain Monder. Instead of fighting, we parlayed, and we used our collective brains to get past the many traps of the Crypt. At the base, a strange naga with a dwarven head waited for us, demanding a share of the Cyne fortune in return for his years of defense. We were only too happy to negotiate, giving the Golden Masks as well as the naga their fair share, extracting a favor from the Masks.

      After a moment's respite, we decided to take on the castle, with acquiring the crown forefront in our minds. Taking the secret paths outlined on our maps, we encountered the great magic gate, but not before we slew an awful cockroach demon of some sort. The Master Key did its job, disabling the gate with nary a sound. Infiltrating the palace, we dispatched overgrown plants and strange druids before dropping a couple of the were-hellhounds. Beyond, we encountered the new Queen playing with a strange goblin. I knocked out the princess, but we discovered that she was some sort of small hag - Eridesce finished her off after that. 

      We continued, looking for the crown. On the ground floor we ran into a couple of palace workers who were hiding in fear - apparently the new residents have been killing for sport. We then talked to the noble quartermaster who informed us that the queen was meeting with some Gorse bootlickers. We were able to ambush a couple of the guards, and violently make our way to the meeting room. Our foes fought well, but they were no match for our combined might. The dowager - herself some sort of magician - was able to escape, but we slew the other imposter Queen and acquired the cursed Crown (which I promply placed in the antimagic chest) as well as the famed Falcon Blade.

      Fearing for an army of guards around the corner after the dowager escaped, we ran for our lives back through the secret tunnel. As we emerged, rather than the state of the city improving with the suppresed curse of the crown, a dome of shadow emerged over the city. We're all probably public enemy #1 at this point - we've returned to the manor just for a second, to regroup. What will we do next? What will happen to us?

      Well, this might be my last entry in the Material Plane. Hopefully not! Let me explain.

      We hid out in Cyne Monder's tomb after rendezvousing with our crew at the manse. We advised everyone to split - sure enough, we heard announced that we're wanted individuals - a 1000 GP reward for information, plus 3000 GP for our bodies, dead or alive. What a sum! Resting, we brainstormed what to do. Torggo suggested putting on the crown, and using it to end the curse. I vetoed that - I've had enough of the consequences of misusing magical artifacts. Another suggestion was trying to assassinate the dowager - but it seems like a long shot when she can flee to a different plane at will. We finally decided to try Plan C - talk to a potential heir - a bastard son - about challenging the current regime.

      Before trying Plan C, we decided to investigate the strange dome. It seems that living things cannot pass through it, but non-living things can, with difficulty.

      We went back to the menagerie to talk with him, learning that he was a wanted man, too. His second-in-command had a plan to smuggle him out of the city as part of a troop movement. Apparenty the Queen has the power to rise and lift the dome at will. We went along with this plan, but we learned it was a setup - they tried to kill us as soon as we arrived! Fighting for our lives, we slew another of the false queen-hags, and once again a spellcaster got away.

      Fleeing, a new individual stopped us on the way back to the menagerie. He claimed to be the leader of the Golden Masks, who we had "worked" with earlier in Cyne's tomb. Talking with him, he claimed to know that the source of the shadow dome is coming from the Shadowfell - and he has a way to plane shift there. In return for a trip there and back, he wants us to deliver some good to an associate of his. Typical. This looks like our only option, so tomorrow, we prepare to travel to this realm of hopelessness. I've got something planned for my friends before we go - to raise our spirits.
