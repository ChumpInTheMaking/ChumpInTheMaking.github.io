      <div class="entry-date">Session 1 - May 30, 2025</div>
      Wow, this city is big - bigger than anywhere else I've ever been! I decided to get a tour of the city with a local bard who goes by Wordsplasher. We walked by a place called the Alley of Menace that folks were warned never to go near. Naturally, these gnoll schmucks waltz right in, and ran right back out. Problem was, they came out swinging those axes of theirs! Me and a few other folks stood their ground and prevented Wordsplasher's guts from splashing all over the cobblestone. To thank us, he bought us a round at the Lucky Leap, where we all got to know each other a bit. There's Deevey, a human - around my age, I think. There's Torggo, a dwarven cleric. Fin is a goliath with a massive axe. Oh, there's also this kid slinging spells who can't be more than ten years old - Eridesce, I think.  I got invited to some shindig by some fancypants noble at the end of the week. Anyway, I'm writing this from a room in the Blackhorn, where I'm staying my first night. Adventure awaits!

      <div class="entry-title">Busy Days in Onadbyr</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 2 - June 6, 2025</div>
      Another day - more adventure in Onadbyr! In the morning, Torggo said he had an errand to run at the Temple of Life. I wanted to see more of the city, so it made sense to accompany him - and sure enough, everyone ended up coming along, too - the kid and the giant and the wizard. Folks down on their luck were - get this - turning into pigs! It didn't take long for Torggo to figure out that someone was spiking the oatmeal - vile behavior. I got to see the Redcloaks in action - judge and jury. Best not to break a law while I'm here. Anyway, after that we looked into something Deevey was interested in - a dwarf had gone missing after he had claimed to enter a sunken tower that hadn't been breached in hundreds of years. We did some investigating - after 'entering' his home, we discovered a handful of animated skeletons trashing the place! After dispatching them, suffering a few bumps and bruises, we found the dwarf - Tightlips - hiding in a secret compartment. He paid us with some pretty nice jewelry! While him and Torggo boarded up the tunnel he had made, folks ran some errands. I sold the jewelry and divvied up the coin - someone noticed I had received an odd coin with a golden mask that apparently is a symbol of some secret society - I wonder who handed it to me? Later, I shadowed the kid to a grove she wanted to visit - just to be on the safe side. She turned into a wolf! I got out of there - I, uh, don't think she needs looking over any more. After some late night relaxing at the Blackhorn, enjoying their fine mead, Fin had waay too much and crashed out. The owners wanted him out, but we didn't exactly know where he was staying, so we brought him up to my room instead to sleep it off. After we caught our breath, we heard a kid screaming outside, so we went to investigate. Some lady was trying to kidnap a kid no older than Eri! We spooked her, I guess, 'cause she just vanished after Deevey tried a Magic Missile on her. The kid couldn't walk - something about a magical curse - and it sent me back to that moment years ago. I knew we had to do everything in our power to fix him - but as it turns out, she had whispered the solution to the boy - he had to dance with a giant. The next morning, he did some groovin' with Fin, and sure enough, he was cured! Despite it all, hanging out with these folks has been a lot of fun. Maybe I'll take them with me to the Fancypants Ball later this week!

      <div class="entry-date">Session 3 - June 13, 2025</div>
      It's been a few days since I updated this log - what's happened? Let me just start by writing that I begrudingly attended the in-hindsight-poorly-named Fancypants Ball and ended up catching some sort of fever there. I will write no more of that. I went rumor hunting in the city by doing some bar hopping - tavernkeeps always know what's going on, whether it's a big city like Onadbyr or a dump like Yellowkeep. There's a fancy ball coming up in a few days - maybe we can wrangle an invitation somehow.  Fin also had a lead on some work working as a sous chef for a local food competition. We served food to the Princess - I think I'll speak for all the citizens of Onadbyr when I say that I'm glad she's not in line to the throne. Anyway, I thought my side had the victory in hand, but the kid - er, Eridesce - helped her chef pull it out in the end. We walked away with a princey - or should I say princessly - sum. Royals will spend tons of money on anything, it appears! I also discovered some old writing on a wall near the Alley of Menace - turns out it was a lead to a bonafide treasure hunt! It led to the bottom of an old bar, where we've convinced the owners to dig around in exchange a lot of coin, but we get to keep what we find! I'll take the lead when we get in there - hopefully no one gets hurt. I also learned that someone's daughter - a halfling girl named Byra - had gone adventuring and hadn't returned. I agreed to help without reservation, and luckily my new friends agreed. We traveled a few days north of the city to a lumberjack camp where a manticore had been harassing the workers - Byra had come here to slay the manticore. She'd been missing for a while, but we tracked her down a few hours away - trapped in a huge web! It turns out she had a pretty good plan, but had accidentally trapped both her and the manticore. Her 'secret weapon' was possessed by some sort of worm creature. It was a scary fight, but my friends and I prevailed with Byra's help. Byra wants to be an adventurer, but I tried to talk some sense into her - it's best to travel with a party, or a partner. I'm well aware that's still no guarantee of safety.  I feel like I ought to have moved on by now, but these new colleagues keep pulling me back in.  At least the coin is good so far.

      <div class="entry-title">Odd Jobs</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 4 - June 20, 2025</div>
      I'm writing this entry from the Blackhorn, where I continue to stay with the kid and Torggo. I haven't got around to forging my own path, yet - the coin is just too good! Our treasure hunt paid off big - we found a magical adamantine spear buried in an old saferoom underneath that bar. 200 GP split five ways was more than worth it - I bet the adamantium alone would be worth that, let alone the enchantment! I was going to fence it, but later that evening, the spear found some use. Someone had dropped off a burial urn for Torggo at the Blackhorn. But when Deevey tried to take it back home for analysis, a ghost popped out, wanting revenge! It possessed Deevey, and nearly killed Torggo and Fin. I was scared shitless! Our weapons and spells weren't much use, so, thinking fast, I threw the magic spear to Fin, who was able to score some effective blows. We also did an odd job cleaning out some old mansion for a well-renowned mercenary group - perhaps this will lead to more opportunities down the road. Pretty easy work - but the mansion was full of mold that Eri had to blast with ice, and some small ice elementals were a minor nuisance. Deevey found some pearl earrings that might pay off big. Oh - also, Byra's parents were real thankful when her daughter came back home. Not only did we score an unlimited supply of day-old baked goods, we got a job that gets us in to the invitation only ball. What else... oh, we also heard that the King and Prince had taken a retinue to some local bog or something and hadn't come back yet. Weird. Anyway, got to get to sleep - the kid wanted to go to some menagerie tomorrow, and apparently if I pretend to be her parent, we get in free. Actually, now that I write it down, it sounds fun!

      <div class="entry-title">Crime and Punishment</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 5 - June 27, 2025</div>
      Hey, it's me, again. The menagerie was a lot of fun - I think I ended up eating more spiced nuts than Eri, though. On our way out, we spotted an old man who had just been stabbed! We ran to help him, and thanks to a little magic from Eri's berries, he recovered. He was Lord Karramosa - and to show his thanks, he gave us a sack of gold and some tickets to his invitation-only gala. A few days later, we attended the gala - I had to buy some nice clothes for the occasion. Locke, old boy, you don't clean up half-bad! Anyway, the food was great - exotic stuff - and the wine was superb - not that I know anything about that. Apparently Lord Karramosa is in more danger than he thinks - Eri and Deevey swear they saw the drink he was handed had been spiked in some way, implicating his young wife and her friend, Victoria Violet. Er - more about that later. Eri made a show of spilling his glass to save him, but needs to work on selling it a bit more. Later, I snuck away and ran into Byra for a bit. It was nice to talk about old times, and the old days. I like Byra quite a bit - she reminds me of, well, me. After the party wrapped up, we were walking home when we came across some young folks from the party - one of them was crying, holding their ankle. Torggo went to help, but they pulled knives on him! We fought in a tight skirmish - our opponents knew what they were doing - clearly experts, and they had poisoned blades! We laid them low, but Deevey caused another commotion with his Thunderwave spell. In a panic, we took one of the ones that Deevey had caused to fallen asleep back to the Blackhorn. We tried to interrogate her, but she wasn't talking. That's when I learned I'm not cut out for this kind of work - Deevey and Torggo wanted to torture or kill her! I stuck to my guns, though - I'm not a killer. We settled on a plan of dumping her - alive - in the outskirts of town, where Eri hid as a spider - wow! - on her person and found out that she worked for - get this - Vickie Violet! I don't know what we'll do next, but I know this - I'm getting a new room in a differnt tavern - it isn't safe here anymore.

      <div class="entry-date">Session 6 - July 11, 2025</div>
      Hey - I gotta write this one quick. After the encounter with the assassins, we decided to lose some heat by visiting the Gorse estate up north to return some pearl earrings we found. Apparently House Gorse has fallen on hard times - they used to be respectable folk, but there's defintely some weirdness going on. We managed to get an audience, but all the locals and some guards warned us that the Gorses can be... mecurial. Anyway, I drew the short straw and ended up trying to explain to the head Gorse that we were returning some earrings that belonged to his family. I did that trick that Celeste taught me - she always did it better. Old man Gorse was definitely in a bad spot, but seeing those earrings seemed to bring some clarity to his mind as he remembered. Get this - in return for the earrings, he gave us the deed to his estate in the capital! What a score! There's a lot of fixing up that needs to happen, but real estate in that location - it's worth a fortune! Later, back in the capital after we got the paperwork for the manse filed, we stopped by the Lucky Leap for information and drinks. While we were there, some halfling was trying to sell a valuable feather to the Crown Warden. He had the sale complete, but some loan shark came in and demanded some money he was owed, burning the feather in the process. We tried to help him out by getting another from his granny, but it turns out that the feathers were worthless. I wonder what happened to him? To make things ever weirder, the Crown Warden stopped by our manor the next morning, explanining that he was not involved in that transaction - someone was posing as him! To clear his name, he hired us for some work to check on a servant and retrieve a horse - apparently there's some folks doing dark rituals. That doesn't sound good. Gotta go - I'll write again when back in the city.

      Hey. It's been a few weeks - I thought I should write an update. We went out to the country like I wrote earlier, and found a stable that had been lit aflame. We were able to save the horses, and a servant let us know there were some folks, including the Crown Warden's servant, being held hostage nearby. We rushed to their aid, finding some folks in the middle of dark rituals, just like we'd heard. We fought some sort of devil - a devil! - but we weren't able to save the servants and the children the devil murdered. Is this what being an adenturer really is? Innocent folks dying? I've had enough of that.

      But happier things have happened, too. The kid - Eridesce - celebrated her 10th birthday. Byra's become a friend. We're making money. I gotta remember what I promised her - that I'd live the life she wanted me to live. Coming up is the King's Games - it's going to be a lot of fun. I'm planning on competing in quite a few events - you can't win if you don't play, right?
