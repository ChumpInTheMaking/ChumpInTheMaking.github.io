      <div class="entry-date">Session 1 - May 30, 2025</div>
      Wow, this city is big - bigger than anywhere else I've ever been! I decided to get a tour of the city with a local bard who goes by Wordsplasher. We walked by a place called the Alley of Menace that folks were warned never to go near. Naturally, these gnoll schmucks waltz right in, and ran right back out. Problem was, they came out swinging those axes of theirs! Me and a few other folks stood their ground and prevented Wordsplasher's guts from splashing all over the cobblestone. To thank us, he bought us a round at the Lucky Leap, where we all got to know each other a bit. There's Deevey, a human - around my age, I think. There's Torggo, a dwarven cleric. Fin is a goliath with a massive axe. Oh, there's also this kid slinging spells who can't be more than ten years old - Eridesce, I think.  I got invited to some shindig by some fancypants noble at the end of the week. Anyway, I'm writing this from a room in the Blackhorn, where I'm staying my first night. Adventure awaits!

      <div class="entry-title">Busy Days in Onadbyr</div>
      <div class="entry-date">Session 2 - June 6, 2025</div>
      Another day - more adventure in Onadbyr! In the morning, Torggo said he had an errand to run at the Temple of Life. I wanted to see more of the city, so it made sense to accompany him - and sure enough, everyone ended up coming along, too - the kid and the giant and the wizard. Folks down on their luck were - get this - turning into pigs! It didn't take long for Torggo to figure out that someone was spiking the oatmeal - vile behavior. I got to see the Redcloaks in action - judge and jury. Best not to break a law while I'm here. Anyway, after that we looked into something Deevey was interested in - a dwarf had gone missing after he had claimed to enter a sunken tower that hadn't been breached in hundreds of years. We did some investigating - after 'entering' his home, we discovered a handful of animated skeletons trashing the place! After dispatching them, suffering a few bumps and bruises, we found the dwarf - Tightlips - hiding in a secret compartment. He paid us with some pretty nice jewelry! While him and Torggo boarded up the tunnel he had made, folks ran some errands. I sold the jewelry and divvied up the coin - someone noticed I had received an odd coin with a golden mask that apparently is a symbol of some secret society - I wonder who handed it to me? Later, I shadowed the kid to a grove she wanted to visit - just to be on the safe side. She turned into a wolf! I got out of there - I, uh, don't think she needs looking over any more. After some late night relaxing at the Blackhorn, enjoying their fine mead, Fin had waay too much and crashed out. The owners wanted him out, but we didn't exactly know where he was staying, so we brought him up to my room instead to sleep it off. After we caught our breath, we heard a kid screaming outside, so we went to investigate. Some lady was trying to kidnap a kid no older than Eri! We spooked her, I guess, 'cause she just vanished after Deevey tried a Magic Missile on her. The kid couldn't walk - something about a magical curse - and it sent me back to that moment years ago. I knew we had to do everything in our power to fix him - but as it turns out, she had whispered the solution to the boy - he had to dance with a giant. The next morning, he did some groovin' with Fin, and sure enough, he was cured! Despite it all, hanging out with these folks has been a lot of fun. Maybe I'll take them with me to the Fancypants Ball later this week!

      <div class="entry-date">Session 3 - June 13, 2025</div>
      It's been a few days since I updated this log - what's happened? Let me just start by writing that I begrudingly attended the in-hindsight-poorly-named Fancypants Ball and ended up catching some sort of fever there. I will write no more of that. I went rumor hunting in the city by doing some bar hopping - tavernkeeps always know what's going on, whether it's a big city like Onadbyr or a dump like Yellowkeep. There's a fancy ball coming up in a few days - maybe we can wrangle an invitation somehow.  Fin also had a lead on some work working as a sous chef for a local food competition. We served food to the Princess - I think I'll speak for all the citizens of Onadbyr when I say that I'm glad she's not in line to the throne. Anyway, I thought my side had the victory in hand, but the kid - er, Eridesce - helped her chef pull it out in the end. We walked away with a princey - or should I say princessly - sum. Royals will spend tons of money on anything, it appears! I also discovered some old writing on a wall near the Alley of Menace - turns out it was a lead to a bonafide treasure hunt! It led to the bottom of an old bar, where we've convinced the owners to dig around in exchange a lot of coin, but we get to keep what we find! I'll take the lead when we get in there - hopefully no one gets hurt. I also learned that someone's daughter - a halfling girl named Byra - had gone adventuring and hadn't returned. I agreed to help without reservation, and luckily my new friends agreed. We traveled a few days north of the city to a lumberjack camp where a manticore had been harassing the workers - Byra had come here to slay the manticore. She'd been missing for a while, but we tracked her down a few hours away - trapped in a huge web! It turns out she had a pretty good plan, but had accidentally trapped both her and the manticore. Her 'secret weapon' was possessed by some sort of worm creature. It was a scary fight, but my friends and I prevailed with Byra's help. Byra wants to be an adventurer, but I tried to talk some sense into her - it's best to travel with a party, or a partner. I'm well aware that's still no guarantee of safety.  I feel like I ought to have moved on by now, but these new colleagues keep pulling me back in.  At least the coin is good so far.
